# Week 3 - Statistics Fundamentals
- Practice:
    - Write a function to compute mean, variance, and std dev from scratch (no numpy.mean)
    - Simulate coin flips and calculate probability of getting 3 heads in 5 flips.
- Dataset: Synthetic random samples from numpy.random.normal
- Homework: Generate a dataset of 100 exam scores (mean=70, sd=10). Compute mean, std dev, 95% confidence interval, and plot histogram.
